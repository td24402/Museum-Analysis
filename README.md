# Museum-Analysis
This project is about museums and artists and artworks that belong in the museums. 
I used SQL and python to analyze museums, artists and artworks. 
SQL queries such as which style of artwork sells the best, which artists have the most amount of artwork in museums, which museums are open the longest throughout the week, etc...
For python after cleaninig and preparing the data, I found out what price each artowk sells for and at what frequency, also found out if canvas size has an effect on sale price.
